It's not really a secret that among Indonesian tech company founders, Wenas Agusetiawan and Juny Maimun have a legendary status in the underground hacking communities especially in the 1990s and the 2000s.

In 2000, Wenas Agusetiawan was [arrested for unauthorized network intrusion](https://data.tempo.co/MajalahTeks/detail/ARM20180612121540/hacker-indonesia-tertangkap-di-singapura) into NUS' network. He was active under the handle `hC-` (short for "Hantu Crew" where "hantu" is an Indonesian word for "ghost"), [as mentioned in this Wikibooks page](https://id.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sejarah_Internet_Indonesia/Juli_2000_hC_di_adili_di_Singapura).

Juny Maimun (more commonly referred to as Acong) was also [covered by a news site](https://www.viva.co.id/arsip/130394-acong-hacker-insaf-yang-suka-berbagi) in 2010 as a hacker who already got into countless of servers, using `bagan` as his hacker handle.

Wenas Agusetiawan is now primarily known as [one of the co-founders of Tiket.com](https://rocketreach.co/wenas-agusetiawan-email_442071), a major Indonesian online travel agent. Meanwhile, Juny Maimun is primarily known as [the founder of Indowebster and Maxindo](https://www.viva.co.id/arsip/130394-acong-hacker-insaf-yang-suka-berbagi). Indowebster used to be a popular online forum in Indonesia back in the 2000s and early 2010s, and Maxindo is an ISP.

Both of them used to be in a local underground hacking group called AntiHackerlink, and they used to hang out in an IRC channel called `#antihackerlink` on [DALnet IRC](https://www.dal.net/).

I don't have any personal ties with them, aside from having the opportunity to meet Juny Maimun once in 2012 where he was together with the late Arif Wicaksono, another AntiHackerlink member known with the handle `sakitjiwa` (which means "mental illness" in English). But one of the people who taught me cybersecurity (and mentored me in many ways) used to hang out in the same underground community as them. I'm not going to name the person here since they never even mentioned the name of AntiHackerlink community or the handle they used during their illegal hacking days (I think I might have figured it out already though).

What I meant to do in this post is to document a hack by AntiHackerlink in 2003, as I happened to stumble upon an evidence of the hack happening in [an old mailing list archive](https://marc.info/?l=incidents&m=104198322804808&w=2).

Your proxy was probably hacked, not google's.

I cleaned up the HTML code of the "defaced Google" from the email and opened it as a HTML file on a browser to see what the person saw back on 7 January 2003 when they thought Google was hacked. Here it is.

![The defaced "Google" homepage](/images/posts/antihackerlink-2003-hack.png)

I also uploaded the static "defaced Google" page [here](/static/2003-antihackerlink-defaced.html). As you can see, `bagan` is listed as one of the people involved in the attack. That should be Juny Maimun.

Now, why am I documenting this? One reason is that the story of this hack was told to me as a case study by the AntiHackerlink member who taught me cybersecurity back when I was a student.

They never told me it was something they did for real, they just told me that there was a case where someone tried to open `www.google.com` and saw a defaced web page. This person then thought that Google was hacked, but in reality the one that got hacked was the DNS server. When the person opened `www.google.com`, the DNS resolver didn't respond with Google's IP address and gave the person the IP address of the hacked site instead.

I think what I found was the remains from the exact story they used as a case study when teaching me network security fundamentals 15 years ago. Hence, I think it's worth documenting for personal reasons, and probably worth documenting for other people to see as a historical artifact of early 2000s' Indonesian underground hacking scene also.
