As someone who didn't have any interest in software development, I have to say that I'm a software engineer by accident. While I like computers, I kind of being lost here.

In 2013, upon finishing my final project in college, I joined Bukalapak as a software engineer. I found it much more enjoyable than I thought before, so I continued to be one even though I didn't really plan to keep being a software engineer for a long time when I applied to be one.

Maybe I have too many things happening in my life by accident. I considered myself a master student by accident too. I didn't think I was suited to be a graduate student, yet I was a graduate student despite all I wanted to do is just tinkering with stuffs without doing any academic papers and assignments.

Fortunately, most of them ended up alright. While being a master's student wasn't as enjoyable as being a software engineer, I learned some good things there.

At least the accidents aren't so bad, some of them are quite good. And that sums up the introductory post for this blog. Here's a piece of "Hello World" code.

```scala
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = println("Hello, World!")
}
```
