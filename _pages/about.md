I'm **Edwin Tunggawan**, across the Internet I usually use the handle **`sdsdkkk`** unless when it's not available for me to use. I've been working as a software engineer in Indonesian tech startups since I graduated from university in 2013.

Outside work, I usually spend my time exploring topics that interest me. Sometimes it takes a bit more dedication (such as pursuing a master's degree in computer and information security back in 2014-2015), but most of the time it's just me reading books and exploring topics I'm interested in by myself.

Lately I'm trying to revisit mathematics, physics, and statistics materials I used to study since I didn't study hard enough back in high school and college. I kind of regret it now that I have a good idea what I can do with them.

This blog contains my posts from 2015 onwards, and you should notice that the content changes over time. Posts from 2015-2019 are mostly rants on software engineering, systems design, and information security with occasional writeups of VulnHub challenges and vulnerabilities I found on random systems I was checking. Posts from 2020 are mostly writeups of me digging deeper into mathematics and statistics in order to strengthen my foundational computer science knowledge.
