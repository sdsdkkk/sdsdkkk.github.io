I'm **Edwin Tunggawan**, across the Internet I usually use the handle **sdsdkkk** except when it's unavailable. I've been working as a software engineer in the Indonesian tech startup scene since 2013.

Outside work, I usually spend my time exploring random topics that catch my interest. Sometimes it takes a bit more dedication (such as pursuing a master's degree in cybersecurity back in 2014-2015), but most of the time it's just me reading books and papers, and finding various materials to explore on my own.

This blog contains my posts from 2015 onwards, and you should notice that the content changes over time. Posts from 2015-2019 are mostly my opinions on software engineering, systems design, and cybersecurity with occasional writeups of VulnHub challenges and vulnerabilities I found on random systems I was checking. Posts from 2020 are mostly writeups of me digging deeper into mathematics and statistics in order to strengthen my foundational computer science knowledge.

The posts I write for this blog are usually related to software engineering, computer science, systems administration, or cybersecurity. I do have interest in other topics as well such as history, psychology, political science, and many others. But I don't usually do more than just reading books or watching documentaries for those other topics, so I don't have as much to write on them.

A quick summary about me:

- Studied Computer Science at Universitas Multimedia Nusantara (2009-2013). I took some courses specialized for network administration while studying there, I also served as a teaching assistant and a member (and later, the manager, as the community's hype faded and other members lost interest) of the INSECxT cybersecurity community. One notable thing I did while in INSECxT was finding a way to extract the plaintext passwords of the student body from the academic information system used by the university back then.
- Studied Information Technology at Swiss German University (2014-2015). I took a concentration in cybersecurity, but I also picked up some data mining skills when I was there. One notable thing I did while studying there was finding that I could send spoofed emails from the university's mail server, after learning about mailing infrastructure in a class.
- Worked at Bukalapak (2013-2017) as a software engineer and briefly as a security engineer. I was the top contributor of the company's codebase when I left, I also managed the bug bounty program and [built a cool anti-phishing system](/2025-06-04/how-i-built-an-anti-phishing-system) for them.
- Working at Cermati (2017-present) as a software engineer specializing in VoIP, then expanding to cloud infrastructure, a bit of data engineering, but now I'm an engineering manager who primarily handles their cloud infrastructure, platform engineering, and cybersecurity stuff. I'm [CISSP-certified](/2019-02-02/getting-certified), but you probably don't want to emulate [how I learned cybersecurity](/2025-06-09/you-shouldnt-learn-security-the-way-i-did).

I consider myself to be primarily a software engineer with interests in systems architecture and security. I've been holding a managerial role at Cermati since 2018, so Iâ€™ve been learning to manage people and teams for quite some time now.
