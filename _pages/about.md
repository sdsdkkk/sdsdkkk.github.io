I'm **Edwin Tunggawan**, across the Internet I usually use the handle **sdsdkkk** on the Internet unless when it's not available for me to use. I've been working as a software engineer in Indonesian tech startup scene since 2013.

Outside work, I usually spend my time exploring random topics that interest me. Sometimes it takes a bit more dedication (such as pursuing a master's degree in cybersecurity back in 2014-2015), but most of the time it's just me reading books and exploring random topics by myself.

This blog contains my posts from 2015 onwards, and you should notice that the content changes over time. Posts from 2015-2019 are mostly rants on software engineering, systems design, and cybersecurity with occasional writeups of VulnHub challenges and vulnerabilities I found on random systems I was checking. Posts from 2020 are mostly writeups of me digging deeper into mathematics and statistics in order to strengthen my foundational computer science knowledge.

The posts I write for this blog are usually related to software engineering, computer science, systems administration, or cybersecurity. I do have interest in other topics as well such as history, psychology, political science, and many others. But I don't usually do more than just reading books or watching documentaries for those other topics, so I don't have as much to write on them myself.
